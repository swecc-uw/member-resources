# Resume Tips

- Transfer your resume into a template resume (google them there a bunch of them, even on word and docs), it’s an easy way to get a polished look. No need for anything crazy, and avoid very styled and picture oriented resumes as they are difficult to parse. Make sure it’s parsable by using a resume parse tool (here’s one: [resume-parser.vercel.app](https://resume-parser.vercel.app/))
- You should like how your resume looks, if you don’t like it, why expect others too.
- Make sure keywords related to your industry of interest are present as a lot of resumes are filtered using programs that look for keywords. If you’re applying to a job, make sure that keywords from the job description are on your resume (this is sometimes how resumes are filtered programmatically).
- Use as many numbers or metrics as you can. This is easier than you think, but requires creativity (as does many parts of crafting a resume). For example:

    McDonalds (Worker) - Summer 2020

    I worked at McDonalds over the summer to make money

    VS.

    McDonalds | Crew Member | June 2020 - September 2020

    Worked about 40 hours a week over the summer with a team driving about $3000 in sales everyday.

    Attended monthly trainings and engaged with community members to optimize the customer experience.

    In addition to the second one sounding like you did more, people will appreciate the fact that you’re working hard to show yourself off.

- If someone wanted to get in touch with you, they would email you first and then ask for your phone number. Don’t feel obligated to have your physical address and phone number on your resume
- Your resume from top to bottom should have your: name and info → education → experiences → coursework/skills/awards etc.
- Seek out your own resources! Ask the career center to look over your resume, or your friend. Google videos or pictures of people’s resumes. A lot of companies run workshops or have videos of how to make a good resume (google and microsoft for example), pick your favorite big company and see if they have any tips online!
- You should brush up on your resume frequently, there is no perfect resume because it's subjective, but you can keep working towards perfection by updating it and revising your wording etc.

# Application Tips

- It’s a numbers game, so you need to apply as much as possible. Don’t stress that everything in your resume is perfect otherwise you’ll start applying way too late. Give yourself a deadline of when you want to start applying and honor it.
- If you really want to work for company X, get a referral from someone working there. Ideally you have a friend, if not, use LinkedIn and...
