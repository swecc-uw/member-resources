<h1 style="font-size: 40px; color: purple;"><i>Step-by-Step Guide to Securing SWE Internship Referrals through LinkedIn</i></h2>


<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple; border-bottom: 2px solid #333;">Step 1: Create a Stellar LinkedIn Profile</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Start by crafting an impressive LinkedIn profile that showcases your skills, projects, and any relevant experience.
    Use a professional photo and write a compelling summary that highlights your passion for software engineering.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    For those already with experience under their belt, showcase it like a pro. And if you're still looking to gain that experience, worry not; you're in the right place! Keep an eye out for opportunities posted in our discord server, and feel free to ask if anyone has any leads.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    The name of the game is credibility, so make sure there aren't any negative signals on your profile. Ask friends and peers for feedback, or to just give your profile a quick glance.  
</p>


<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 2: Build Your Network</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Expand your network strategically. Begin by connecting with friends, colleagues, and classmates. Join LinkedIn groups related to software engineering to find like-minded professionals.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    After connecting with enough of your peers, you should start to get reccomendations. Don't be afraid to connect with anyone and everyone, the worst they can do is ignore/reject your request. At this stage you can begin connecting with industry professionals as well, which will pay off in the long run.
</p>


<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 3: Research Target Companies</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Identify the companies you'd love to intern at. Research their engineering teams and the specific departments you'd like to work in. Follow the company pages and stay updated with their latest news and job openings, but more importantly to sway your connection reccomendations.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 4: Find Relevant Contacts</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Leverage the power of LinkedIn's search to find employees who work in the departments you're interested in. Look for Software Engineers and Managers, as they will be the most valuable additions to your network.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 5: Personalize Your Approach</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Start reaching out to your new connections. Avoid generic messages when reaching out, as it is pretty obvious when you write a copy-pasteable message. Craft personalized messages for each person, expressing your genuine interest in their work and the company. Be respectful of their time and keep your message concise.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 6: Establish Authentic Connections</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Engage in meaningful conversations with your new connections. Ask insightful questions about their experiences, projects, or the company culture. Show genuine interest in their responses and establish a rapport.
</p>


<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    This is an absolutely crucial step, and will likely take a lot of time to execute. I reccomend reaching out to as many people as possible, since your response rate probably won't be great. Don't worry, it's 100% a numbers game. Once you find people that are willing to have a conversation, put your all into demonstrating that YOU would be a valuable addition to their network as well. If you find yourself sending the same message to multiple people, that is a sign you aren't engaging in <i>real</i> conversation.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 7: Demonstrate Your Skills</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    If you have relevant projects or contributions, share them with your connections. Look for opportunities to inject your own experiences and opinions into the conversation. This showcases your abilities and passion for software engineering. Stay humble, but don't be bland and predictable.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 8: Inquire About Referrals</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    After building a strong connection and demonstrating your value, politely inquire about the possibility of a referral for the SWE internship position. Avoid being pushy and let the person decide if they are comfortable providing a referral. It is essential that you establish a real connection <i>before</i> dropping the question, as they are a lot more likely to consider you after getting to know you a little.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Keep in mind that in a lot of cases, referring you is akin to sticking their neck out for you and putting their reputation on the line. 
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 9: Prepare for the Application</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    As you wait for potential referrals, prepare your internship application materials. Polish your resume, create a captivating cover letter, and gather any additional portfolio items or project documentation.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    If you were offered a referral, now is the time to hold up your end of the bargain by preparing for the interview and making yourself the strongest candidate possible. Ask for feedback or advice on strengthening your application, and don't be afraid to take constructive criticicsm.
</p>


<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 10: Apply with Referrals</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    As SOON as the internship opens up, reach out to your lead and let them know you're ready to apply. Make sure you do this before applying, since many companies have a completely seperate application pool/portal for referrals. Send your resume, contact info, and the job listing you wish to apply for, and thank them for doing you such a huge favor.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 11: Follow Up</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Keep your connections informed about your progress. Whether you progress to interviews or receive an offer, share the
    news with those who supported you along the way. Express your gratitude for their help and guidance.
</p>

<h2 style="font-size: 24px; color: purple;">Step 12: Continue Networking</h2>

<p style="font-size: 16px;">
    Even if you secure an internship, continue networking and expanding your connections. Maintain relationships with your
    new contacts, as they can offer valuable insights and future opportunities in your software engineering career.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
    By following this step-by-step guide, you'll be well on your way to securing valuable SWE internship referrals through LinkedIn, setting the stage for a successful and rewarding career in software engineering. Best of luck on your
    journey!
