# NON-MAJOR FINESSE

### A list of things non-majors can do as UW students to get access to normally major-only content

- Check to see if your major allows you to take certain CSE courses (ex. EE majors can take CSE 351)


- Petition into major-only classes
These aren’t easy to get, I (Eyad) successfully petitioned into two classes. In general, try to be specific in why you want the specific class you’re applying for, and make the reason unique to you (i.e. tie it into an activity that you’re doing). The more concrete and specific your reason is, the more likely you’ll get it

    - Requested CSE 331 got CSE 341: I said that I wanted to be more prepared as I represent UW in my summer internship
    - Requested CSE 333 and got it: I said that this class would help me as a developer on the avionics team for Society for Advanced Rocket Propulsion (SARP)


- Take non-major courses
You will have to retake these courses if you switch into CSE
CSE 414 for CSE 344 is the only known exception (to me)
After you’ve taken CSE 373, you have access to major-only career fairs
